"""
Authoring helper: jump from the rendered book - or a projected slide - back to
its source.

Run this alongside a local preview build, then in the book:

  * alt-click any paragraph  -> opens that spot in your text editor  (option A)
  * alt-shift-click          -> edit the text in place, save, done   (option C)

and in the deck player (assets/class.html, served from a web-deck build):

  * alt-click a slide        -> opens its source: the <slide> block in
                                source/*.ptx, or the deck's JSON entry
  * alt-shift-click          -> edit a bullet / caption in place, or open a
                                form for a glue slide's fields

    python3 scripts/edit-server.py                    # this project
    python3 scripts/edit-server.py --project ../ENGS28

The browser half lives in assets/ptx-edit.js and is injected only by the
"web-edit" target, so nothing here can reach a deployed build.

Deliberately local-only: it binds to 127.0.0.1 and refuses to touch any file
outside the project's source/ directory, because its whole job is rewriting
files on disk in response to an HTTP request.

    the author types, so nobody is invited to edit text that cannot be saved.

    Two things make a block a dead end no matter what is typed:

      * it contains markup whose displayed text is GENERATED at build time
        (math, an xref, a character entity). That text has no counterpart in
        the source, so the block can never round-trip and every save would be
        refused as a mismatch.
      * none of its text is its own — every character belongs to nested inline
        markup, so there is nothing here this can safely rewrite.

    A block holding ANY inline markup is a dead end too, and this is the case
    that cost real work before it was one. The write is refused per changed
    span, so editing the prose *around* <c>GPIOA</c> does land — which made
    partial editing look supportable, and the browser marked the marked-up
    words contenteditable=false so they could not be typed into.

    That protection does not hold. Selecting a block and retyping it deletes
    the non-editable spans outright: the selection reads as just the owned
    text, so the edit looks safe right up until the replacement removes the
    markup from the DOM and the save is refused — after the rewording is done.
    Since the guard cannot be trusted, the offer is withdrawn: a block with
    markup opens in the editor, where every kind of edit to it actually works.

    The last test is the catch-all, and the reason this takes `shown_text`:
    apply_edit demands that what the page displayed matches the source EXACTLY
    before it will write, so anything that renders differently from its source
    is a dead end no matter how it got that way. The named cases above give a
    better message; this catches the rest — most usefully a page built before
    the source last changed, which no list of tags could anticipate.
