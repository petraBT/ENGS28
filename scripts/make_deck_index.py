"""Write assets/decks/index.json — the deck player's table of contents.

The player is served as static files, and a static host has no directory
listing, so the list of decks has to exist as a file. This regenerates it from
the decks themselves, so the titles can never disagree with what a deck says
about itself.

Run it after adding or renaming a deck:

    python3 scripts/make_deck_index.py

preview-slides.sh runs it on every start, and check_deck.py fails if the
committed index is out of date — so the usual way to notice is to be told.

Ordering is teaching order, which is not alphabetical: Day 1, then Day 1X,
then Day 2 … and a day's pre-class video sits with its day rather than at the
end. That comes out of the id (day7x sorts inside day 7), which is why the
sort key is parsed rather than taken from the filename.
