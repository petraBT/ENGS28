"""Strip instructor-only slides from the deck JSON inside a STUDENT deck build.

The XSL strips instructor slides from the HTML of the "web-deck" target, so the
answers are not in its page source. The deck JSON is a different pipeline:
PreTeXt copies assets/ verbatim into <output>/external/, so the copy that lands
beside the stripped pages still lists every instructor slide. Two things go
wrong if it is left alone:

  * the player looks the slide up by id, does not find it, and fails the deck
    with 'Slide "..." not found' — 29 times, in a build that is otherwise
    correct;
  * the entry's "title" is readable in the JSON, and the titles are things like
    "Solution — blink, dim, write". Less than the answer, but not nothing.

So the deck list is filtered to match the pages beside it. This runs against an
OUTPUT directory and never touches assets/decks/ — the source keeps every slide,
because the instructor build needs them.

    python3 scripts/filter_student_decks.py output/web-deck

Nothing to do for web-deck-instructor: that build renders the slides, so its
deck JSON should list them.
